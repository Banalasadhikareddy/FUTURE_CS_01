Cyber Security Task 1- WEeb Application Vulnerability Assessment
Task-1 Overview
This repository contains the practical work completed during task 1 
The objective of this task is to identify, analyze, and document common web application vulnerabilities using *OWASP Juice Shop*, a deliberately vulnerable web application.

The task focuses on understanding real-world attack scenarios and demonstrating them using industry-standard security testing tools.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- OWASP Juice Shop  
- Burp Suite  
- Firefox Developer Tools  
- Kali Linux
  
Description

This project demonstrates performing a web application vulnerability assessment using ethical hacking techniques. The objective was to identify common security vulnerabilities in a test web application and analyze their impact based on OWASP Top 10 guidelines
  
 🔍 Vulnerabilities Identified
The following vulnerabilities were successfully tested and documented:

1. *Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)*
   - Injected malicious JavaScript payloads via user input fields
   - Verified script execution in the browser

2. *SQL Injection*
   - Intercepted authentication requests using Burp Suite
   - Manipulated SQL queries to bypass authentication controls

3. *Broken Authentication*
   - Analyzed login mechanism behavior
   - Identified lack of proper protections such as rate limiting and account lockout

Outcome

Gained hands-on experience in:

Web application security testing

Identifying and analyzing OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

Using OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning

Creating professional security assessment reports
